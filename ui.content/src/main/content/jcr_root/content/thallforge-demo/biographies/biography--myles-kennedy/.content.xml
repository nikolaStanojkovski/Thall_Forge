He is the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the rock band&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Bridge&quot; title=&quot;Alter Bridge&quot;>Alter Bridge&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Slash_band_members&quot; title=&quot;List of Slash band members&quot;>Slash featuring Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;alongside guitarist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(musician)&quot; title=&quot;Slash (musician)&quot;>Slash&lt;/a>. A former guitar instructor from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane,_Washington&quot; title=&quot;Spokane, Washington&quot;>Spokane, Washington&lt;/a>, Kennedy has worked as a session musician and songwriter, making both studio and live appearances with several artists, and has been involved with several projects throughout his career.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Born in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston&quot; title=&quot;Boston&quot;>Boston, Massachusetts&lt;/a>, and raised in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Idaho&quot; title=&quot;Northern Idaho&quot;>Northern Idaho&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and Spokane, Kennedy attended&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spokane_Falls_Community_College&quot; title=&quot;Spokane Falls Community College&quot;>Spokane Falls Community College&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;to study music theory. He began his music career in 1990 as the lead guitarist of the instrumental jazz ensemble Cosmic Dust, with which he released one studio album. His second band, Citizen Swing, released two studio albums before disbanding in 1996. With fellow Citizen Swing member Craig Johnson, Kennedy founded the rock band The Mayfield Four, for which he provided lead vocals and guitar. The band released two studio albums and broke up in 2002. After declining an offer to audition as the lead vocalist of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolver&quot; title=&quot;Velvet Revolver&quot;>Velvet Revolver&lt;/a>, he was asked to join Alter Bridge by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Tremonti&quot; title=&quot;Mark Tremonti&quot;>Mark Tremonti&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;in late 2003, formally joining in 2004, and he has been with the band ever since. He has released seven studio albums with Alter Bridge.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>While Alter Bridge was on tour in 2008, Kennedy and former members of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin&quot; title=&quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;>Led Zeppelin&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;met and improvised as a group in an informal jam session, but the band never fully materialized. He then started working with Slash, featuring on the guitarist's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(album)&quot; title=&quot;Slash (album)&quot;>2010 eponymous solo album&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;on two tracks and later serving as Slash's vocalist on tour. In 2012, Kennedy filled in with short notice for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N%27_Roses&quot; title=&quot;Guns N' Roses&quot;>Guns N' Roses&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;lead singer&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axl_Rose&quot;>Axl Rose&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;when Rose refused to show up for the band's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame&quot; title=&quot;Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&quot;>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;induction ceremony.&amp;nbsp;With Slash, Myles Kennedy and the Conspirators have recorded four studio albums.

In late 2009, it was reported that they would be working together on Slash's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_(album)&quot; title=&quot;Slash (album)&quot;>self-titled debut solo album&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;Slash later confirmed that Kennedy was chosen to sing and co-write the final song, &amp;quot;Starlight&amp;quot;, on his album.

The other members of Slash's band are rhythm guitarist Bobby Schneck (replaced as of the Apocalyptic Love tour with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sidoris&quot; title=&quot;Frank Sidoris&quot;>Frank Sidoris&lt;/a>), bassist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Kerns&quot; title=&quot;Todd Kerns&quot;>Todd Kerns&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(formerly of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Electric&quot; title=&quot;Age of Electric&quot;>Age of Electric&lt;/a>), and drummer&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Fitz&quot; title=&quot;Brent Fitz&quot;>Brent Fitz&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(formerly of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_a_Deadman&quot; title=&quot;Theory of a Deadman&quot;>Theory of a Deadman&lt;/a>).

It was also announced that band mates Bobby Schneck, Todd Kerns, and Brent Fitz, along with Slash, would complete the lineup for the album.&amp;nbsp;In an interview with MusicRadar, Slash confirmed that it would be less of an actual solo album and more of a collaboration album with Kennedy, and that he was not sure if the album will be billed to Slash or a new name entirely.&amp;nbsp;As of December 2011, three songs had been recorded: &amp;quot;Halo&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Standing in the Sun&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Bad Rain&amp;quot;.
