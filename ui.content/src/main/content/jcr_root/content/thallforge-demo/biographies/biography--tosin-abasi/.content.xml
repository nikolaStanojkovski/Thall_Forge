His brother, Abdul Abasi, is a former drill sergeant in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military&quot; title=&quot;United States military&quot;>United States military&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and is currently a fashion designer.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Abasi is a mainly self-taught guitarist. He first picked up a guitar at his friend's house, simply strumming it and making up basic&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lick_(music)&quot; title=&quot;Lick (music)&quot;>licks&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;on the spot. At this time, he was being exposed to some music through learning the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarinet&quot; title=&quot;Clarinet&quot;>clarinet&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;in elementary school. He later began to rent&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_metal&quot; title=&quot;Glam metal&quot;>hair metal&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;guitarists' instructional video tapes from his local music store, saying that some &amp;quot;were videos you did not want to be caught watching&amp;quot; due to racy material in certain tapes (e.g. women in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini&quot; title=&quot;Bikini&quot;>bikinis&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Abasi said that when he decided to learn the guitar, his father was &amp;quot;totally liberal about the whole thing and encouraging and proud&amp;quot; and in fact, bought him his first guitar. However his mother initially held a more conservative outlook. Tosin said in an interview, &amp;quot;My mom definitely represents more of the traditional immigrant mentality of education and conventional channels being way more important than a creative endeavor&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>In 2009, he recorded the first Animals as Leaders release with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha_Mansoor&quot; title=&quot;Misha Mansoor&quot;>Misha Mansoor&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;(of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periphery_(band)&quot; title=&quot;Periphery (band)&quot;>Periphery&lt;/a>), who produced and recorded the album with Tosin, as well as programming the drums. Javier Reyes and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navene_Koperweis&quot; title=&quot;Navene Koperweis&quot;>Navene Koperweis&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;were enlisted on rhythm guitar and drums, respectively, after the completion of the album, turning the project into a full touring band.&lt;sup>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosin_Abasi#cite_note-GEdge-5&quot;>[5]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;He also toured with the band&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_of_Osiris&quot; title=&quot;Born of Osiris&quot;>Born of Osiris&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;as a stand-in guitarist for former member Matt Pantelis whilst they were auditioning for a permanent replacement.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>In 2011, Tosin started putting together material for a new band, T.R.A.M., consisting of his Animals As Leaders bandmate Javier Reyes,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_Tendencies&quot; title=&quot;Suicidal Tendencies&quot;>Suicidal Tendencies&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;drummer Eric Moore, and former&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mars_Volta&quot; title=&quot;The Mars Volta&quot;>The Mars Volta&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;wind instrumentalist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adri%C3%A1n_Terrazas-Gonz%C3%A1lez&quot; title=&quot;Adri치n Terrazas-Gonz치lez&quot;>Adri치n Terrazas-Gonz치lez&lt;/a>. &amp;quot;T.R.A.M.&amp;quot; stands for Terrazas, Reyes, Abasi, Moore. In mid-March 2011, T.R.A.M. played their first show at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sxsw&quot; title=&quot;Sxsw&quot;>South by Southwest&lt;/a>, a multi-day music festival in Austin, Texas. Tosin explained that he formed T.R.A.M. as a trio consisting of himself, Javier and Adrian as an outlet for some ideas he had written which he felt did not fit with Animals as Leaders. Eric Moore was not added into the lineup until the recording phase of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_Franca_(album)&quot; title=&quot;Lingua Franca (album)&quot;>the album&lt;/a>, and wrote and performed all the drums on the album within a few weeks.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>Animals as Leaders released their second album,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Weightless&lt;/i>, on November 8, 2011. Abasi was reportedly meeting with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha_Mansoor&quot; title=&quot;Misha Mansoor&quot;>Misha Mansoor&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;again in late 2012, and it was reported that a new Animals as Leaders album was in the works, due to be released in 2013.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>At NAMM 2013, Tosin Abasi's signature guitar, the Ibanez TAM 100, was revealed. This guitar is based upon the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibanez_RG2228&quot; title=&quot;Ibanez RG2228&quot;>Ibanez RG2228&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;model, which he had been using for some years, and contains his signature&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiMarzio&quot; title=&quot;DiMarzio&quot;>DiMarzio&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;Ionizer pickups.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>On March 19, 2014, the Animals As Leaders album&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joy_of_Motion&quot;>The Joy of Motion&lt;/a>&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;was made available for streaming, via YouTube. On March 24, 2014, the album was released in Europe, March 25 in North America and on March 28 in Australia and New Zealand by Sumerian Records.&amp;nbsp;The album was met with widely positive reviews.&amp;nbsp;In July 2014, Tosin appeared in the first episode of Guitar Power, a web-series sponsored by D'Addario String and Rolling Stone Magazine.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>As of March 2014, he was on tour with Animals As Leaders. In October 2014, it was revealed that Abasi would join&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Satriani&quot; title=&quot;Joe Satriani&quot;>Joe Satriani&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_Govan&quot; title=&quot;Guthrie Govan&quot;>Guthrie Govan&lt;/a>, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Keneally&quot; title=&quot;Mike Keneally&quot;>Mike Keneally&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G3_(tour)&quot; title=&quot;G3 (tour)&quot;>G4 tour&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;in 2015.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>In April and May 2016, Abasi joined fellow guitarists&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Bettencourt&quot; title=&quot;Nuno Bettencourt&quot;>Nuno Bettencourt&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yngwie_Malmsteen&quot; title=&quot;Yngwie Malmsteen&quot;>Yngwie Malmsteen&lt;/a>,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Vai&quot; title=&quot;Steve Vai&quot;>Steve Vai&lt;/a>, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakk_Wylde&quot; title=&quot;Zakk Wylde&quot;>Zakk Wylde&lt;/a>, as part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Axe&quot; title=&quot;Generation Axe&quot;>Generation Axe&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;tour.&lt;sup>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosin_Abasi#cite_note-11&quot;>[11]&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&amp;nbsp;The supergroup later reprised their tour in 2017 in Asia, and North America once more in 2018.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>In August 2020, it was revealed that Abasi was the musician behind the &amp;quot;air guitar&amp;quot; shredding in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_%26_Ted_Face_the_Music&quot; title=&quot;Bill &amp;amp; Ted Face the Music&quot;>Bill &amp;amp; Ted Face the Music&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>In late March 2022, Animals as Leaders's&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrhesia_(album)&quot; title=&quot;Parrhesia (album)&quot;>Parrhesia&lt;/a>&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;was released; though generally positive, critics mostly held consensus that the album was not the band's strongest work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Metal Sucks&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;gave the album a 3/5, citing shifts towards Abasi's minimalism style leading to more ambient work but fewer &amp;quot;&lt;i>wow&lt;/i>&amp;quot; moments;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Pitchfork&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;gave the album a 7.3/10, noting the album as making strides towards a refinement of the group's style;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i>Guitar.com&lt;/i>&amp;nbsp;rated the work 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;&lt;p>&lt;a href=&quot;/content/thallforge-demo/discover/artists/spotlight--tosin-abasi.html&quot;>Listen&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&#xd;&#xa;"
