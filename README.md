# ThallForge - Progressive Metal Streaming & Discovery Platform

### **Overview**
**ThallForge** is a Progressive Metal streaming platform dedicated to discovering, streaming, and promoting underground and well-known progressive metal bands, including subgenres like **djent, thall**, and **alt-metal**. It offers curated music experiences, band recommendations, and access to exclusive content.

## Modules

The main parts of the project template are:

- **[all]** - A single content package that embeds all of the compiled modules (bundles and content packages) including any vendor dependencies
- **[core]** - Java bundle containing core functionality like OSGi services, listeners, or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
- **[ui.apps]** - Contains the `/apps` (and `/etc`) parts of the project, including JS & CSS clientlibs, components, and templates
- **[ui.config]** - Contains runmode-specific OSGi configurations for the project
- **[ui.content]** - Contains sample content using the components from `ui.apps`
- **[ui.frontend]** - An optional dedicated front-end build mechanism (General Webpack project)

## How to Build

To build all the modules, run the following command in the project root directory with Maven 3:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
```

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

```bash
mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish
```

Or alternatively

```bash
mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Daem.port=4503
```

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

```bash
mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle
```

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.apps`)

```bash
mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
```
